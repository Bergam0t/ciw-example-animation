This book contains example documentation and open working for a computer simulation model applied to a healthcare problem. The model is a simple discrete-event simulation of an urgent care call centre. The model is implemented in `python` and `ciw`.

The book covers the following aspects of open working for simulation:

* Sharing your model code and parameters with other researchers and simulation modellers.

* An example of documenting your model using the STRESS reporting checklist (for DES).

* Providing a simple executable version of your model for other to verify results.
