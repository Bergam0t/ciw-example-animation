## 2.2. Base model logic

Callers arrive at random with inter-arrival times following an Exponential distribution at a rate of 100 per hour. Call length can be represented by a triangular distribution. Calls last between 5 minutes and 15 minutes. Most calls last 7 minutes. There are 13 call operators.

After a patient has spoken to a call operator their priority is triaged. It is estimated that 40% of patients require a callback from a nurse. There are 9 nurses available. A nurse patient consultation has a Uniform distribution lasting between 10 and 20 minutes.

There is only a single class or patient in the model.

## 2.3 Scenario logic

Experimentation in this model is simple and varies the number of resources available.
