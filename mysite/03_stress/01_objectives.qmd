## 1.1 Purpose of the model

::: {.callout-tip title="Primary purpose"}
The simulation model provides a framework for decision makers to evaluate the impact of different resourcing for call operators and advanced nurse practitioners on queues and other efficiency criteria in the urgent care call centre.
:::

## 1.2 Model Outputs

At the end of a model run the average waiting times and resource utilisation is calculated for each of the following activities.

* Call triage by call operator
* Nurse consultation call back

Results are generated using multiple independent replications. No warm up period is employed.

## 1.3 Experimentation aims

* Increasing call operator capacity by +1
* Increasing advanced nurse practitioner capacity by +1
* Increasing chance of nurse callback by +5%
